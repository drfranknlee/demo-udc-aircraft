# Scenario 5: Extract Metadata with Deep-Inspection & AI Model


With this scenario, you will be able to deploy an object-dectection model and wrap it into a Spectrum Discover Deep-Inspect app that can recording the inference results (eg. type of objects and confidence level) into the metadata catalog. 

The work is in progress and the intitial report can be accessed in [PDF](recording/T101389-Scenario5-v20210922.pdf)
