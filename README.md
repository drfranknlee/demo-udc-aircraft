# Demo -- Unified Data Catalog for Military Aircraft


Spectrum Discover is an industry-leading unstructured data catalog platform that can be plugged into by various applications and tools for data discovery services. 


This repository includes instruction, dataset, manifest and recording to recreate a demo based on Spectrum Discover to ingest, index, tag and extract insight from a military aircraft dataset. The output is a well-curated and easily-accessible dataset ready for HPC-based preprocessing and deep learning/AI training. 


The instruction below uses the dataset in "set-T101389". The raw data is a collection of 11 military aircraft images from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/a2015003713/militaryaircraftdetectiondataset/version/29). Here is an example aircraft image from the dataset:
